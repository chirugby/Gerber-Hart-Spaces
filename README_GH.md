# Gerber-Hart Spaces
G/H Spaces maps the historic and current locations of LGBT spaces back to the 19th century, based on the resources of the Gerber/Hart Library and Archives in Chicago, Illinois.  

In the future, we look to introducing (verifiable) crowd-sourcing capabilities and defining areas (polygons) which were known to be comunity hubs, but where specific addresses aren't known.  

The underlying dataset has been designed to be extensible to cover the entire United States and integrated with similar efforts in other areas such as New York City and Los Angele.s

The code for G/H Spaces is based on the OUTGoingNYC project (outgoingnyc.com) by Jeff Ferzuco, then of CARTO.  We expect that the data will be extended and enhanced over time.
