<p id='aboutDescription'><strong>About this project</strong><br>OUTgoing: The Hidden History of New York's Gay Nightlife – is an effort to map documented historic locations of gay nightlife in New York City as far back and comprehensively as possible. We now have all 50 states with legalized gay marriage, and the LGBT experience is in the midst of a 21st century upshift. It's time to look back and get some perspective and data – in order to look forward. From historic records, we’ve gathered 00 nighttime spots – bars, clubs, bathhouses, coffee houses, cruising areas, late-night diners, etc – from the 1800s to 2015. It is nowhere near complete.

> FAQ:
</br>
<strong>Where are you getting your data?</strong></br>
> Mainly <strong>gay guidebooks</strong>, which have been produced to help queers navigate strange cities since about 1966.
<br> > Anything before then comes partially from  <strong>texts about gay life </strong> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gay-New-York-Culture-1890-1940-ebook/dp/B002R81CSC" target='_blank'>Gay New York</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gay-Metropolis-Landmark-History-America-ebook/dp/B005012PFW/" target'_blank'>The Gay Metropolis</a>, etc.) which have documented locations and clues to follow to find others. Also, there are municipal records – old police records and liquor licenses – but still researching those.
<br> > As a project that attempts to document people who are in fluid in their characters and preferences, we use  <strong>anecdotal stories, hearsay and gossip  </strong>to reinforce our research. dates and specifics may not be accurate, but rest assured, it makes for a good time. <a href='http://bit.ly/outgoingform' target='blank'>Tell us if you have gossip:)</a>
<br><br>
A catalog of sources is coming very soon.

</br><br><strong>What other cities are you considering?</strong></br>
For the moment, New York is the one being actively built out. San Francisco has a good base of information, so it will begin development in the end of summer. It’ll require some travel. There is a GoFundMe to help with that effort.

</br><br><strong>How are you choosing sites?</strong></br>
This whole process is more of an art than a science. The locations are places of business that had their main activity after dark, or supported life after dark and were popular or used by LGBTs.

</br><br><strong>What do the data parts mean?</strong>
</br>> Name: The name of this location and, if identical in name to another, a qualifier (v1, v2, v3, after-hours, etc).
<!-- </br>> Location: The actual address, or intersection. it is speculated that many bars in the 50s and 60s never had their actual address in guides to avoid violence to members (see The Great Society on the map). -->
</br>> Open/Close dates: Approximate dates on most, more verified dates are coming. If you see one wrong, please let us know. If a date is completely unknown on both ends, it is generally listed as 5 years earlier and later, just to give a possible range.

</br><br><strong>When are the stories and images coming?</strong>
We are looking at a Fall 2015 release of this feature.

</br><br><strong>There is a bar on your map that isn’t gay. Why?</strong>
Some locations had a strong gay clientele for awhile then the crowd shifted. Example: The Four Seasons in the 50-60s was popular with gays but isn’t really now – so is listed only for that time approximate period.
