# Gerber/Hart LGBT Spaces

GH Spaces is a project of the Gerber/Hart Library and Archives (gerberhart.org).  

The data is built from the historical assets of Gerber/Hart and the hard work of our volunteers.  This project owes a huge debt to the OUTgoing NYC project (www.outgoingnyc.com) by Jeff Ferzuco and CARTO (www.carto.com).  Jeff provided the software template and CARTO provides the technical framework used for the site. 

From the readme.md of OUTgoing:
OUTgoing maps the historic and current locations of LGBT nightlife spots back to the 19th century, using archived gay guides, crowdsourcing, and first-person accounts. The map and soon-to-be released story and image archive will be a record of how the LGBT community has come together at night â€“ to give perspective on the past and the future.  

All data is in formation, and will be for awhile.
