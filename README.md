# OUTgoing

OUTgoing maps the historic and current locations of LGBT nightlife spots back to the 19th century, using archived gay guides, crowdsourcing, and first-person accounts. The map and soon-to-be released story and image archive will be a record of how the LGBT community has come together at night â€“ to give perspective on the past and the future.  

All data is in formation, and will be for awhile.
